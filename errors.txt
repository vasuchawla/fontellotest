Hi, 

I integrated Intilaqa SDK and also added the depdendency JitsiMeetSDK in pod file. 
After adding the JitsiMeetSDK, the below errors are coming up in run time.
The root cause is that JitsiMeet is also using React-native internally and the compiled framework binary includes a  copy of compiled react native classes. 
The app also uses react native which results in duplicate classes of same name.


To resolve this issue, i even tried Jitsi Meet's react native sdk ie https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jitsi/react-native-sdk 
But this sdk gets added to app as a static framework, where as Intilaqa is expecting a dynamic linked framework hence that too is throwing the error on app launch.

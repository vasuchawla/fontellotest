step 1: install library
    Run the command "npm install --save react-native-sim-cards-manager" to install the librarly


step 2: add permissions
    Make sure the below 2 permissions are added in AndroidManifest.xml file 

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_NUMBERS" />

    READ_PHONE_NUMBERS is a subset of READ_PHONE_STATE but is explicitely needed in this case

Step 3: Create the build again. To include the new libraries in the build, a re-build is required.

Step 4: Refer the SimInfoScreen.js
This file shows a poc on how the functionality works. For example, i created a button which calls a function called getSimInfo.
This function first requests for the permissions and once granted calls "getSimInfoInner" to actually get the sim details and then stores the sim details in a state variable. (in wavemaker you will need to store this in model variable instead)
Then in render function, i have listed all properties that are fetched related to the library. some of the properties are availble in only android and not only in ios.

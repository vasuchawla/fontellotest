To get the user/onboarding info from previous app..

We have 2 options


Option 1: If new app will have same bundle id as that of previous app.

Inputs required in this case:
We just need to know how/where is the previous app storing the login info. If its SharedPref  in android or keychain in ios..or some other storage mechanism. Also, if the data is being encrypted before storing, then what encryption algo is being used.


Option 2: If the new app will have a new bundle id.
In this case, there are some further options and rules as below

        - Old app need to have a ContentProvider class in code, 
        - New app will have to use ContentResolver in code

        - New app can then get the login info from "Android Account Manager"
